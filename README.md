# Radar System	

This Arduino project focuses on detecting objects near it, with a range of 50cm. An IR sensor is mounted upon a servo motor that rotates by an angle +90° and -90°. This IR sensor, calculates the distance between an object placed in front of it and itself. If the object is close enough (5cm), an LED glows.

Radar systems are implemented on large scale in military sectors, aircraft navigation, air traffic control, naval ships, etc. 

NOTE: This project was a demonstration and will **NOT** receive any further developments.
